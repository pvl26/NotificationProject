# NotificationProject

A script which sends notifications with custom icons and sound, currently we only have two classes of notifications:

 1. Health
    - Notification to take a break from hour to hour
    - Notification to drink water once in 30 minutes
    - Notification eat a fruit once in 1 and a half hours

 2. Culture
    - Notification with info about music instruments
    - Notification with info about important women along history
    - Notification with info about cool destinations

Anyone can add more methods for any type of notifications, geting the information is based on webscraping from wikipedia or any other site.
